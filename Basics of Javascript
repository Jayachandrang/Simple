Comparison Operators:
*********************
1. Equal (==)	Returns true if the operands are equal.	
     3 == var1 or "3" == var1 or 3 == '3'
2. Not equal (!=)	Returns true if the operands are not equal.	
     var1 != 4 or var2 != "3"
3. Strict equal (===)	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. 
      3 === var1

4. <script> alert(); </script>  O/P: You will get undefined error. Even you forget to give semicolon.
   <script> alert(1"); </script>  O/P: You will get UNEXPECTED token ILLEGAL.
   <script> alert(''); </script>   O/P: You will get empty dialog box. (either it will be empty or null).
   
   If you include the above script tags, in between the <html></html>, it is taking so much time to load. 850ms.
   But if you include after </html> tag in your page, it loads faster with 301ms.
   
5. Writing to the document output from JS
   <script>
     document.write("<p>My First JavaScript</p>");  // The example writes a <p> element directly into the HTML document
   </script>
   
6. <script>
       document.getElementByID("myDiv").innerHTML="How are you?";
   </script>
    O/P: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'getElementByID', so make sure that you are using correct method 'getElementById'.
 
 7. Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables.
     The value of the variable carname will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of the following two statements:
       var carname="Volvo"; 
       var carname;
